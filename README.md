Basically, the shut-yer-mouth-VS-Code-I'm-an-adult-kit.

## Purpose
Just a bunch of settings one could use as a starting point in created a less noisy VS Code experience
out of the box for those who are quite familiar already with its settings.

## Usage

You could merge with your own setting.json file or not...choices, choices! Or simple clone
this repo, move 'quieter.json' to your VS Code settings.json location and rename it to
settings.json.

## Pull Requests
Welcome! But as SADBFL, I have final subjective opinion over "sensible defaults". Deal.

Basically, the shut-yer-mouth-VS-Code-I'm-an-adult-kit.

## Purpose
Just a bunch of settings one could use as a starting point in created a less noisy VS Code experience
out of the box for those who are quite familiar already with its settings.

## Usage

You could merge with your own setting.json file or not...choices, choices! Or simple clone
this repo, move 'quieter.json' to your VS Code settings.json location and rename it to
settings.json.

It is intended as sort of zen-mode (Ctrl/Cmd+K Z) light, turning off most distractions and
notification/confirmation annoyances while using 'regular' mode (non-zen).

I use these settings combined with ```View: Toggle Full Screen``` most of the time.

## Pull Requests
Welcome! But as SADBFL, I have final subjective opinion over "sensible defaults". Deal.
